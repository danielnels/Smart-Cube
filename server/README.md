## Node.js, Express.js, Mongoose - React Build / API Server

This portion of the repo is for the node.js server that does several things:

-   Serves the React front end application via build folder
-   Connects to a MongoDB NoSQL database for data persistence
-   Models, connects and interacts with data/database using Mongoose/Apollo Server/GraphQL
-   Seed functionality to populate the collection with documents
-   Nodemon for more pleasant development

### Installation

This project will be installed and run from the [root directory](https://github.com/DavidTunnell/upstudy-fullstack-react-graphql-apollo-server-node-express-mongodb) using the README instructions there. If you would like to run this server on its own first make sure the node dependencies have been installed with `npm i` and then use `npm run start` or `npm run watch` for development.
